MuskanRecipes – Recipe Finder

This is my Recipe Finder website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.
The project is all about making recipe discovery easy and fun – with search, trending recipes, favorites, pricing plans, and more.

I built it to practice front-end development and to create something that feels modern, interactive, and user-friendly.
